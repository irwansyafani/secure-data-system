Your company is running a test that is designed to compare three different versions of the companyâ€™s website. Version X of
the website is shown to 45% of users, version Y of the website is shown to 30%, while version Z the remaining 25% of users.
The test shows that 12% of users who are presented with version X sign up for the companyâ€™s services, compared to 8% of
users who are presented with version Y and 10% sign up with version Z. If a user signs up for the companyâ€™s services, what
is the probability that she/he was presented with version X of the website?

## Solution

Website X: 45%

Website Y: 30%

Website Z: 25%

---

Signed Up of X: 12%

Signed Up of Y: 8%

Signed Up of Z: 10%

### # Find Total

> 45.12 + 30.8 + 25.10

> 540 + 240 + 250 = 1030

---

### # Convert value to value of part of cake

> 540 + 490 = 1030

assume, 1030 is 100% part of a circle cake.

find how much it takes for y and z:

> 1030 / 490 = 2,10204

2,10204 is the rest part of the cake with decimal number, change it into percentage ðŸ‘‡:

> 2,10204 \* ..... = 100

> 100 / 2,10204 = 47,57283%

recheck the percentage:

> 2,10204 \* 47,57283 = 100

find part of x in decimal:

> 540 / 490 = 1,10204

final result:

> 1,10204/2,10204 \* 100% = 52,4% approximately
